<summary>ðŸ”§ How to contribute?</summary>

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute to the project, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**:
   - Go to the project page on GitHub and click the "Fork" button at the top right. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, which you can modify without affecting the original repository.

2. **Create a branch for your feature**:
   - Open a terminal or command line.
   - Navigate to your local repository (the one you cloned from your fork).
   - Create a new branch to work on your feature or fix with the following command:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-branch-name
     ```
     Replace `your-branch-name` with a meaningful name for your branch, e.g., `add-new-feature`.

3. **Commit your changes**:
   - Make your changes to the source code or documentation.
   - Once you've made your changes, add them to the staging area and create a commit with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add new feature: [description of the feature]"
     ```
     The commit message should be clear and briefly explain what you have changed or added.

4. **Push your branch**:
   - Push your branch with your changes to GitHub (to your fork) using the following command:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-branch-name
     ```
     Replace `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created.

5. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the page of your forked repository on GitHub.
   - You will see a button for "Compare & Pull Request" or "New Pull Request." Click it.
   - Describe the changes you made in the Pull Request and then submit it. This will notify the maintainers of the main project that you have changes to review.
